1. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each of the two scheduling policies? Also, give the advantages and disadvantages of the round robin scheduling policy originally implemented in Xinu.

Linux Scheduler

   Advantages:
   1) No starvation problem.
   2) Requires less CPU processing time because it allows a process running its entire time quantum unless being supended.
   3) Better decision making for processes with same priority because it takes history into consideration, fewer previously execution times will have higher priority.
      
   Disadvantages
   1) Higher computation overhead with more calculations of the priority.


Round Robin

    Advantages:
    1) Fast response time of rescheduling.
    2) Equal execution time for processes with same priority.

    Disadvantages:
    1) Starvation problem, some processes with low priority may never or takes a long time to get executed.


2. Describe the way each of the schedulers affects the NULL process.

Linux Scheduler:
    The NULL process does not get to run as its quantum value is set to 0 .
